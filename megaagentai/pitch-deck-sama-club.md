# SLIDE 2: Problem, Value & Differentiation

## 🚨 The Problem for Sama Club

**Customer feedback is exploding, but actionable intelligence is lagging behind.**

| Challenge | Impact on Sama Club |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Fragmented feedback channels** | Voice, chat, reviews, returns—scattered across systems |
| **Slow insight cycles** | Traditional BI takes **12-16 weeks** to surface issues |
| **Reactive, not proactive** | Problems escalate before teams can act |
| **Surface-level sentiment** | "Negative" doesn't tell you *why* or *what to fix* |

---

## 💰 Business Value for Sama Club

| Metric | Value Delivered |
|--------|-----------------|
| ⚡ **Time to Insight** | 12-16 weeks → **24-72 hours** |
| 🎯 **Root-Cause Discovery** | Know *why* customers are unhappy, not just *that* they are |
| 📉 **Reduce Churn** | Act before customers leave |
| 💵 **Cost Savings** | Automate what takes analyst teams weeks |
| 🔮 **Predictive Alerts** | Forecast issues before they spike |
